# Pomodoro Clock

## Description

This assigned project is my own attempt at building a clock specifically for the Pomodoro Technique.

Pomodoro technique is a method of fully concentrating on a task for a fixed amount of time (usually 25 minutes) in 4 sets/sessions with breaks (usually 5 minutes) in between each set/session and with no external distractions to disrupt the user of the technique during these sessions. For more information about the Pomodoro technique, visit this site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique .

I have used HTML and CSS for this project and have yet to use JavaScript to make the clock dynamic and functional.

This is a test to showcase my knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to use them together to build the front-end of a web page.
